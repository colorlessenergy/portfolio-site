## Built with

* HTML
 * jekyll
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Challenges

I used jekyll which is a static site generator. I had to create a collection to be able separate post about HTML, CSS and JavaScript from courses.

I had to figure out how I am going to teach people. I decided to make text courses instead of videos because I like to think the courses will be a guide you can go back and get snippets from. I had to figure out how to make it so that new people can learn and people can just look at it for code snippets.

I had to figure out how I am going to style the content. Also had to figure out what every post will have.

For the nav I had to figure out what looked nice. I was thinking about either not having a hamburger menu on responsive and just have them be there or having a hamburger menu. I decided it looked better with the hamburger because I had more than 3 links.
